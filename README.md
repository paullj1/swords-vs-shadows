Swords vs Shadows
=================

This project was a challenge to learn how to build an interactive game in a few hours. We chose to build a tower defense game in HTML and CSS, and had originally released the game as a Facebook application.

##The Team
This project was the product of a class at the University of Akron in the Summer of 2010.  Our team consisted of four members.  Two of them (myself included) were computer science majors who were responsible for the JS, an art major who was responsible for creating the game artwork, and a project manager who did some of the CSS/HTML.  The whole team collaborated on the story line.

##What's Good
* Creative Use of New Technologies (No Flash - We built this in 2010 when HTML5 and CSS3 were new buzzwords)
* Fun Project with the Purpose of Learning

##What's Bad
* Front End Performance is Terrible
* Amateur Code Quality
* Never Fully Finished
