Swords vs Shadows
=================

This project was a challenge to learn how to build an interactive game in a few hours. We chose to build a tower defense game in HTML and CSS, and had originally released the game as a Facebook application.

##My Role and Objectives
I was the team leader and responsible for the HTML, CSS, audio and credits video. Our team also included two computer science majors who were responsible for the JS, and an art major who was responsible for creating the game artwork. The whole team collaborated on the story line.

##What's Good
* Creative Use of New Technologies (No Flash - We built this in 2009 when HTML5 and CSS3 were new buzzwords)
* Fun Project with the Purpose of Learning

##What's Bad
* Front End Performance is Terrible
* Amateur Code Quality
* Never Fully Finished

##See It In Action
